# Fitting-an-unknown-function
A data set of input-output pairs is given, where the outputs are generated by an unknown, nonlinear but
static function f. The outputs are corrupted by noise, which is assumed to be additive and zero-mean
Gaussian. The function has two input variables and one output variable. I will have to develop a
model for this function, using a polynomial approximator. A second data set generated using the same
function is provided for validating the developed model. The two data sets will be given as a MATLAB
data file, containing one structure for each set. The training data structure is named id and the validation
data structure val.
